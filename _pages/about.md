Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Shubhranshu Pattnaik** [[Resume]](https://ShubhranshuPattnaik.github.io/files/ShubhranshuPattnaik_Resume.pdf).

Iâ€™m a **Masterâ€™s student in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California**, specializing in machine learning, computer vision, and generative AI. My passion is creating intelligent systems that adapt, learn, and interact meaningfully with the world.

Before USC, I gained valuable experience at [D.R.D.O](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs-and-establishments/terminal-ballistics-research-laboratory-tbrl), developing a predictive model with 98% accuracy using Random Forest and SVM. At [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/), I implemented YOLOv3 for human and object tracking with 97% accuracy and developed helmet-less rider detection software with 93% accuracy. I also led scalable software development at [Jungleworks](https://jungleworks.com) and Wayforward IT.

Specifically, my current research focuses include:

  * **Cross-Domain Transfer Learning and Model Generalization:** Designing sophisticated transfer learning architectures to facilitate domain adaptation and model generalization, enabling high-performance across heterogeneous data distributions with minimal labeled data.

  * **Metaheuristic Optimization in Deep Learning Architectures:** Advancing the efficiency and precision of deep learning models through the integration of evolutionary algorithms, leveraging metaheuristic strategies to navigate high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces and optimize neural network topologies.

  * **Advanced Fault Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance:** Creating ML-driven systems using signal processing and adaptive algorithms for real-time anomaly detection and predictive maintenance in complex systems.

Through my research and publications, I aim to create AI systems that are transparent, adaptable, and beneficial to society, bridging the gap between data and decision-making.
